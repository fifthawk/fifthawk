My name is Jack Allen, I am looking to become a front end web developer!

I am currently learning React, with knowledge in vanilla JS as well as CSS and HTML.

Recently, I have become very interested in pulling data from API's and displaying their data.
The projects I have created so far can be seen on my profile here.

Some things that interest me that I am looking to learn in the near future include the MERN stack, as well as Tailwind CSS.

Thanks for checking out my GitHub page! I plan to keep this updated regularly!
